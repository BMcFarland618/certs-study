    - Fault tolerance is the ability to survive a failure of a part of a system. When speaking of RAID arrays, fault tolerance is the ability to protect data from a failure.
    - Raid 1 and Raid 10 = fault tolerance through redundancy
    - Raid 5 = fault tolerance through algorithm

- Raid 0 uses all physical drives like 1 hard drive. Writes portions of data on each drive called stripes. No fault-tolerant protection

- Raid 1 has fault-tolerance through mirroring. Writes all data simultaneously to 2 drives in a mirrored set. 

- Raid 5 Striping with distributed parity or striping with interleaved parity. 
Needs at least 3 drives. If one drive fails, the striping provides actual and parity data to reconstruct the data.

- Raid 10 stripe of mirrors. Need at least 4 drives paired into two mirrored sets. Like 2 disks in a Raid 0 array.

        - L3 (Level 3) cache - larger, slightly further away from CPU but still on the ceramic chip. On multi-core CPU, all cores share L3 cache.
    - CPU Technologies
        - CPU supports a certain word size. The size of the chunk of data that can enter or exit a CPU in one operation

        - X64 Architecture  64-bit architecture  64-bit or 32-bit windows  More than 4 GB of RAM

        - X86 Architecture  32-bit architecture  32-bit windows and 4GB of RAM
    - Advanced RISC Machine
        - CPUS that can understand a lot of instructions are called Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISCs)
        - CPUs with smaller sets of tasks done extremely quickly are called Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
        - Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) are most common RISC CPUs. Used in most mobile devices and gaming consoles today.
    - Clock Speed
        - The speed at which a CPU can potentially execute instructions.
        - Clock speed is measured in GHZ
        - CPUs with faster clock speed will often be more expensive
    - Multithreading
        - A thread or thread of execution is a portion of a program that can run separately from other portions of the program.
        -  Multithreading a.k.a. hyper threading and simultaneous multithreading (SMT), is a CPU tech that allows two or more threads to execute at the same time within a single execution core.
    - Multicore
        - A core is a CPU with its own set of control unit, ALU, and registers.
        - Dual core, Quad-core, even 6-core and 128-core Superchip CPUs are available
        - 2 cores on the same chip can communicate and cooperate much faster than two single core processors on a shared motherboard.
        - More cores usually mean faster and more energy efficient.
    - Virtualization support
        - HAV Hardware-assisted virtualization
        - The ability to manage multiple operating systems running at once through virtual machines - enabled through BIOS/UEFI settings.
    - Configuring a Motherboard
        - BIOS and UEFI
        - BIOS is basic firmware on the motherboard. This is called system BIOS
        - BIOS is responsible for power-on self-test (POST)
        - Traditional PC system BIOS is 16-bit program that requires x86 compliant hardware.
    - UEFI - Unified Extensible Firmare Interface
        - A 32-bit or 64-bit BIOS alternative.
        - UEFI supports file systems that enable booting up large drives, supports 32-bit or 64-bit booting not dependent on x86 firmware

### **Chapter 10**  
- Power supplies
    - Power supplies provide power to all components on the motherboard and is internal.
    - Uses a three prong power socket
    - Power cables coming out of the power supply supply power to motherboard and internal components
    - Typical North American outlets provide 115 volts AC at 60hz
    - Outside the US standard power is 220-240VAC at 50Hz
    - Power supplies can come dual voltage, some that can automatically switch and those that need to be manually switched.
- Small voltage like 3.3V, 5V, and 12V can be assumed as DC(VDC). Large voltages can be assumed as AC (VAC).
- A PC needs a power supply with a capacity that exceeds the total watts required by all the internal components

- A rail, in power supply terms, is a pathway that delivers a specific voltage of power to a specific connection.

- AC Adaptors for Power supplies
    - AC Adapter converts AC power to the voltage needed for a device. It converts AC power to DC power.

- Power supplies come in different form factors
    - Most common power supply form factor is referred to as the ATX power supply.
    - Smaller form factor is known as a micro-ATX power supply

- Most motherboards use 24-pin connectors, called P1 Power connectors
- Soft power allows the computer to be turned on and off via software. Always consider soft power to be on, even if the computer appears to be off.
- A power supply that lets you connect cables to it is called a modular power supply.
- Two traditional peripheral connectors are 4-pin Molex connector, and a smaller 4-pin miniconnector. Molex and mini connector each provide 5 and 12 volts to peripherals
- Most drives will use a SATA connector from the power supply. Look for a 15-pin SATA power cable for hard drives or optical drives
