### **Chapter 8**  
- The Motherboard also known as the mainboard, system board or planar board is made of fiberglass  
- ATX or Advanced Technology eXtended measures 12 inches by 9.6 inches  
    - Micro-ATX, Flex-ATX, and Mini-ATX

|Form Factor | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|ATX         |12x9.6       |
|Micro-ATX(mATX)|9.6x9.6|
|Flex-ATX|9x7.5|
|Mini-ATX|5.9x5.9|
|ITX|8.5x7.5|
|Mini-ITX(mITX)|6.7x6.7|
|Nano-ITX|4.7x4.7|
|Pico-ITX|3.9x2.8|
|Mobile-ITX|2.9x1.77|

- ITX originally named EPIA, used for low-power CPUs  
- ITX boards are mainly used in embedded systems
- Motherboard Components
    - RAM  Slots hold RAM sticks or memory sticks
    - DIMM = Dual Inline  Memory  Module
    - DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 and SODIMM
        - Dual-channel Architecture needs matched pairs of memory. Also come in triple-channel and quad channel.
- Bus Architecture
    - Bus refers to pathways that power, data, or control signals use to travel from one component to another.
        - There are many types of busses. Memory Bus, Expansion Bus, etc.
        - Expansion Bus architecture are PCI, PCIe, and Mini PCIe.
    - PCI = Peripheral Component Interconnect. Transfers data in parallel over  a 32-bit or 64-bit data bus.
    - PCI  slots  are  3 inches long and are used for almost all expansion boards
    - PCIe = Peripheral Component Interconnect Express. New and improved PCI bus.
    - PCIe is not a true bus that transfers data, but a group of serial channels.
    - PCIe connectors have 3 designations x1, x4, and x16. 1, 4, and 16 channels respectively.
    - PCIe x1 is 1.5 inches long, x4 is about 2 inches long and x16 is about 4 inches long.
    - PCIe 1.0 transfers 250MBps per channel. Max transfer rate for PCIe x16 1.0 is 4GBps. 
    - PCIe 2.0 doubled the rate to 500MBps and PCIe 3.0 to 1GBps. PCIe 4.0 doubles that and PCIe 5.0 doubles PCIe 4.0.
    - Mini PCI has a 32-bit data bus like a regular PCI but is smaller.
        - Mini PCI has 3 types. Type 1 and 2 have 100 pins and Type 3 has 124 Pins.
    - Mini PCIe has replaced most Mini PCI in modern Laptops. Faster throughput with a 64-bit data bus.
    -  M.2 = Modern connector type for solid state expansions and drives.
        - M.2 replaced mSATA for mounting solid state storage.
- Motherboard Power Connectors
    - Main Power is a 24-pin connector. 4-pin connectors deliver extra 12 volt power. 6-pin is auxiliary connector that supplies 3.3v and 5v current
    - Some power supplies will have a 20-pin connector + 4 pins. This is a 20+4.
    - 6 and 8 pin power connectors are available for PCIe power boost. These  are 12v connectors and will have yellow abd black wires.
    - 8 pin power connectors also provide additional 12V power.
- Headers
    - Headers are sets of pins on the motherboard to which you can connect a cable.
        - Common port to have a header is USB.
        - USB headers are different. USB 2.0 has a 9 pin header and USB 3.0 has a 20 pin.
- Firmware and Chipsets
    - Firmware is software instructions. Usually held on Read-Only Memory or Rom chips.
    - Firmware built into the motherboard contols basic functions, capabilities and configurability.
    - Firmware on the motherboard includes the chipset and sysstem BIOS.
